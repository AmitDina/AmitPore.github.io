There will be potentially 3-4 rounds of competitions each year. Each completion round will last for 22mins 22secs after which period a winner will be randomly chosen for each brand competition.

Each brand will have its own competition page on the website. The page could also include past winners and the prizes they won.

When the competition period is over or before a new competition has begun the website will show a count down until the next competition. This page could include a sign up form in order to receive a reminder email the day before the completion starts. */</p>

                <p>/* The game is designed to model the decision making environment surrounding a firm’s 

                    innovation strategy and the strategic interactions between innovating firms. The 

                    objective is to demonstrate the critical connections between strategic decisions 

                    relating to capabilities and operational decisions of product development and market 

                    competition. The design of the game implicitly incorporates these components 

                    through a scenario that requires teams (firms) to make decisions at different levels. 

                    Figure 1 represents the decisions that need to be made, and how the different 

                    decisions correspond to the stated components of innovation strategy. */</p>
