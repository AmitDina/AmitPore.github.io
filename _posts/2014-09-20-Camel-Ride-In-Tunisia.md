<p class="type--big">Had an amazing Trip to Tunisia in North of Africa.</p>

It was a wonderful experience to be in that part of world.  Its a very beautiful place with sunny beaches. Temperature is not humid but hot and nice.
 
Tunisia being a french colony until 19th century , most of the people can speech fluent french.

Tunisia is very famous for its doors and you can see loads of beautiful doors around the town .

Scuba Diving in most of the countries is expensive , but in Tunisia it was dead cheap . If someone wants to have an experience of it then , this is the place. 

The Sea is charm and you can see a little coral out 1kms of the beach
