<p class="type--big">Had an amazing Trip to Tunisia in North of Africa.</p>

It was a wonderful experience to in that part of world.  Most of the times it was sunny and temp used to go around 40. 

Tunisia is very famous for its doors and you can see loads of beautiful doors around the town

Scuba Diving in most of the countries is expensive , but in Tunisia it was dead cheap . If someone wants to have an experience of it then , this is the place. 

The Sea is charm and you can see a little coral out 1kms of the beach
