<p>Few weeks back my work computer , was updated with fresh visual studio 2013, I was very keen to work on it , but we both have our production built reedy for it yet. Wanted to explore whats new in 2013 though.</p>
<p>Came across "The Analyze memory usage of managed memory " feature.</p>
<p>Its the great tool to identify a memory issue in the app.</p>
<p>Its explained more on the msdn website.</p>
<p>Unfortunately feature to analyze "Debug Managed Memory" is only available for Ultimate version and not Professional version of VS 2013. </p>

<p> REF : [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21241905/why-i-can-not-find-debug-managed-memory-on-actions-menu) </p>
