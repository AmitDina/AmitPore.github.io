<p class="type--big">As a robotics enthusiastic, I was very keen to attend the Active Robotic Retreat heal in the University of Bath Campus, that too in the same hall 8W 2.11 where my M.Sc. lectures used to be.  It was great to be in the same place after a year.</p>

The 2 day retreat was basically a class held my Parallax (link here) to let people know basic of Robots. They provided with BASIC Stamp 2 microcontroller board and [Boe-Bot and Shield-Bot Refresher Pack]( https://www.parallax.com/product/572-28132) required to start with.

<p class="type--big">First day was introducing the PBasic language and learning circuits. I wrote some simple programs in PBASIC using simple editor provided.  Building circuits was fairly easy using pictures and schematics.

Next step involved to actually loading the program on to the board and it does cool stuffs.</p>

<p class="type--big">Second day was pretty cool to build a Boe BOT using the [Boe BOT kit](https://www.parallax.com/product/28132) The fun started then when I had to use sensors to control the Bots navigation . At the end of the day, there was little competition where all of us where to try our robots, we had a Robot Race and Robot fight.  </p>

<p class="type--big">Even though it was a very basic introductory class, it was much more for Robot new bees. People who donâ€™t know where to Start with and find arduino like boards complicated then this is fun to learn. And they teach programming and building circuits to kids or any robotic fanatic.

Working on arduino or netduino board is quiet similar , More stuffs on that later in my other posts. </p>
